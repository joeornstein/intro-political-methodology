```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# For problem set, echo and eval = FALSE
# For answer key, echo and eval = TRUE
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```

Create an R project, an R script, load tidyverse, and import the modified Freedom In The World dataset you created for the midterm.

## Line of Best Fit

1. Estimate a line of best fit with `liberty_score` as the outcome and `democracy_score` as the explanatory variable.

2. Visualize the line of best fit with `geom_smooth(method = 'lm')`.
  
3. What is the slope of the relationship? What is the p-value?
  
4. Are there any outliers with higher or lower liberty scores than you would expect given their democracy score? Which countries are they? (Hint: create a new variable called `residuals` in your data frame, equal to the true value minus the predicted value).
  
5. Merge with log GDP per capita and re-estimate estimate.
