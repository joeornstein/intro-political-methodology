#Comments:
#I was unable to load the .RData as directed in the Problem Set. I kept getting
#an error stating that no such file existed; however, I was able to load the
#data an alternate way within RStudio. Not sure if this is because I have a Mac.

#CLEAN UP THE DATA
#Creating the variable for age (tbis took me longer than I want to admit)
current_year <- 2020
#the above value is not needed. I could have put "2020" in the below function
#but I wanted to identify 2020 as the current year.
age <- c(current_year - data$birthyr)
#This is overly simplistic and does not factor in leap years. Also, this
#survey is from 2019, so in an actual calculation, wouldn't we need a more
#complicated formula to make the data more accurate? 

#Calculate Median Age of Respondents
median (age)
#The median age is 56 years.

#Making a Histogram of Age
hist (age)

#MISSING VALUES
#Creating a Table of "vote16"
table (data$vote16)
#It appears, if I read this correctly, that 603 people skipped this question.

#Replacing Variable "-1" (skipped) with "NA"
data$vote16[data$vote16 == -1] <- NA

#Recreate Table of "vote16"
table (data$vote16)
#this eliminated the 603 skipped responses.

#EXPLORE THE DATA
#Create Table of "liveurban"
table (data$liveurban)
#The most respondents live in code=3, which is suburb and the second most
#respondents live in code=4, which is cities. Therefore,
#most respondents live in subrubs and cities.

#Figuring Out Rural Vote
table (data$liveurban, data$vote20jb)
#Our rural voters are most likely to vote for code=1, which would be Donald Trump.

#Figuring Out Urban Vote
#We would just reference the table already created via the previous function.
#Urban voters are most likely to vote for code=2, which is Joe Biden.

#THREE INTERETING VARIABLES
#Variable 1:
#For my first variable to test, I wanted to identify movement from rural to
#urban areas or vice versa. Below is the function I performed:
table (data$liveurban, data$youthurban)
#From the table generated, the sum of the first row should show how many people CURRENTLY
#live in a rural area (643 people). The first column, value 1, should show how many people grew up in
#a rural area (321). From this, I gather that almost half of those living in a rural
#area did not grow up there.

#Variable 2:
#For this variable, I wanted to see how many people voted for Trump in 2016 and plan to in 2020.
#I used the variable vote20jb simply because Joe Biden won the primary.
table (data$vote16, data$vote20jb)
#The sum of row 1 should show who voted for Trump in 2016 (1172). To identify who
#plans to vote for Trump in 2020, we need to look at column 1, value 1. From this,
#we can gather that only 89 people plan to switch their vote from Trump. Unsuprising.

#Variable 3:
#For this last variable, I figured I would figure out how long the average (mean)
#duration was for people completing the survey.
mean (data$duration)
#The answer I arrived at was 8663.018 seconds, which is not very useful. I convert
#this into minutes.
mean (data$duration) / 60
#This number still large, so I will convert it to hours.
mean (data$duration) / 3600
#I arrive at 2.406394 hours and will round it to two digits.
round (2.406394, digits = 2)
#Answer is 2.41 hours--which is a long survey!
