In this problem set, you will create an `R` script that performs some basic analysis of the 2019 ANES (American National Election Studies) Pilot Study. More information about that study is [here](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2019-pilot-study/). (Basically, they test a bunch of questions on a non-random opt-in Internet panel, so don't draw far-reaching conclusions from this dataset.)

Make sure to comment your code so that you know what each line is doing, like this:

```{r comment example, echo = TRUE, evaluate = FALSE}
# Compute the median age
median(data$age)
```

When you're done, upload the `.R` file to eLC. Feel free to work with others in the class, but you must submit your own work.

Basic Functions in R

- load() loads a .RData file. load the dataset in the folder 'data/ANES.RData'
- nrow() counts the number of rows (i.e. obseravations) in a dataframe. How many observations are in this dataset?
- ncol() counts the number of columns. How many variables are in this dataset?
- summary() presents a basic summary of the variables in the dataset. How many respondents are missing a response to variable `X`?
- What are the names() of the variables?
- The '$' operator
- What is the average value of X?
- What is the standard deviation (sd) of Y?
- Make a table of Z
- Create a new variable X
- head() displays the
