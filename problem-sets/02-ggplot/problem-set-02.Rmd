This week's problem set is pretty straightforward. Using the 2019 ANES Pilot dataset (or any other dataset of your choice), create **three** visualizations using `ggplot2`. Your submissions should:

1. Communicate some interesting result

2. Use more than one channel/aesthetic (e.g. position, size, shape, color) to maximize the data-ink ratio

3. Be easy to interpret at a glance (you can include a short caption if you'd like)

4. Be *reproducible*; submit three `.png` files with the visualizations, plus the `.R` script that produced them.

Consider this a friendly competition! I will look through the submissions and pick my very favorite visualizations, and their creators will receive honor, glory, and adoration.
