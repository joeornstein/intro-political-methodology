# POLS 7012: Introduction to Political Methodology

This repository contains course materials for my graduate-level Intro to Political Methodology course. In this class, we learn how to confidently work with data using `R` and `RStudio`. Along the way we introduce the fundamental mathematics behind the tools we use in quantitative social science, including optimization, matrix algebra, probability, and inference. You can find the course website [here](https://joeornstein.github.io/pols-7012/).
