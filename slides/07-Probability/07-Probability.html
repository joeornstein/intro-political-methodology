## Outline

A lot of probability/statistics courses are pretty abstract; the great thing about learning `R` first is that we can introduce this in a really hands-on way! 

We'll start by learning about probability distribution functions, and learn how to draw random values in `R`.

We'll see how this procedure underlies **all** statistical inference.

Then, I think, Central Limit Theorem. A little backwards compared to the usual approach, but trust me, let's front-load the good stuff.

Random Variables and their properties: Expectation, Variance, Law of Large Numbers

Multivariable PDFs: Covariance, Joint Probability, Conditional Probability, Bayes Rule

As a bonus, you'll get to practice creating your own functions...very useful when you want to customize / mix-and-match the built-in functions we've learned.

---

# Warm Up

- Create an `R` project where you can keep all your code from this session.

- Create `week7.R` in your project folder. Load `tidyverse`.

--

- Create a object `x` and assign it a vector with the elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.

--


```r
x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4)

# this works too
x &lt;- 1:4
```

--

- Find the sum of your vector `x`. Find the length of your vector `x`

--


```r
sum(x)
```

```
[1] 10
```

```r
length(x)
```

```
[1] 4
```

---

# Warm Up

- What does this expression mean?

`$$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(x)dx = 1$$`
--

The area under the entire curve `\(f(x)\)`, from positive to negative infinity, equals `\(1\)`. 

--

&lt;br&gt;

Keep a copy of these slides open so that you can copy-paste code into your script when needed!

## The Trick Coin Problem

---

## The Trick Coin Problem

Suppose someone flips a coin 100 times and it lands on heads 65 times.

&lt;img src="img/flipping-coin-animated-gif-1.gif" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

**The Challenge:** Is it a trick coin? Or did they just get lucky? How would we know? What is the *probability* of getting that many heads with a fair coin?

---

## The Trick Coin

**Our Approach**: Take a fair coin, flip it an enormous number of times, and see how often you get 65 heads in 100 flips.

--

&lt;img src="img/schitts-creek.gif" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

On second thought, that would be exhausting, so let's make the computer do it instead.

## Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs)

---

## Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs)

A special kind of function that describes the likelihood of random events.

--

### Property 1

`\(P(x) \geq 0\)`

Nothing has a less-than-zero chance of happening.

--

### Property 2

`\(\sum P(x) = 1\)`

The probability of **something** happening equals 1.

???

- (Probability not about coin flips and card games; probability is a function that characterizes our uncertainty over outcomes)

Functions take inputs and produce outputs. PDFs output the probability of an event.


(As Wasserman says, rigor and clarity not synonymous; if you want rigor, check out the books.)

---

## Example PDF: Flipping a Coin

`$$\Omega = \{\text{heads}, \text{tails}\}$$`

`$$P(\text{heads}) = 0.5$$`

`$$P(\text{tails}) = 0.5$$`

--

&lt;br&gt;

For you logophiles out there, this is also known as the **Bernoulli** distribution.

## Generating Random Values

---

## Generating Random Values in `R`

The `sample` function draws values at random (with equal probability) from a vector:


```r
coin_outcomes &lt;- c('Heads', 'Tails')

sample(coin_outcomes, size = 1)
```

```
[1] "Heads"
```

--


```r
sample(coin_outcomes, size = 30, replace = TRUE)
```

```
 [1] "Heads" "Heads" "Heads" "Tails" "Tails" "Tails" "Tails" "Heads" "Tails"
[10] "Heads" "Tails" "Heads" "Tails" "Heads" "Heads" "Tails" "Tails" "Tails"
[19] "Tails" "Heads" "Heads" "Heads" "Heads" "Heads" "Tails" "Heads" "Heads"
[28] "Heads" "Heads" "Tails"
```

---

## Generating Random Values in `R`

### Exercise 1

Flip the coin 100 times, and assign the result to an object called `flips`.

--


```r
flips &lt;- sample(coin_outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
```

--

### Exercise 2

Draw 5 letters at random from the alphabet. (Note: the vector `LETTERS` is built-in to R.)

--


```r
sample(LETTERS, size = 5, replace = TRUE)
```

```
[1] "K" "Y" "Z" "P" "H"
```

## Creating Your Own Functions

---

## Creating Your Own Functions

- An **enormous** strength of working with `R`

- Get comfortable with creating your own functions, and you can make `R` do whatever you want.

---

## Creating Your Own Functions

Here's a (silly) function that takes two inputs and adds 1 to their sum:


```r
add_one &lt;- function(x, y = 1){
  x + y + 1
}

add_one(x = 1, y = 2)
```

```
[1] 4
```

```r
add_one(1)
```

```
[1] 3
```

--

- `add_one` is the name
- `&lt;- function()` assigns a function to that name
- `x, y = 1` are the inputs (aka arguments); `y` has a default value of 1.
- The code within the brackets executes whenever you call the function, and the last line is the function's output.

---

## Creating Your Own Functions

Here's a function that will flip a coin `\(N\)` times and return the result.


```r
flip_coin &lt;- function(N = 100){
  # specify the sample space of outcomes
  coin_outcomes &lt;- c('Heads', 'Tails')
  
  # return a vector of N random coin flips
  sample(coin_outcomes,
         size = N,
         replace = TRUE)
}

flip_coin(N = 8)
```

```
[1] "Heads" "Heads" "Tails" "Heads" "Heads" "Tails" "Heads" "Heads"
```

---

## Creating Your Own Functions

Here's a function that will flip a coin `\(N\)` times and return the fraction that landed on heads. (**Note**: it calls the `flip_coin()` function we just made!)


```r
fraction_heads &lt;- function(N){
  
  # flip the coin N times, assign to 'flips' vector
  flips &lt;- flip_coin(N)
  
  # return the number of heads divided by number of flips
  sum(flips == 'Heads') / N
}
```

--


```r
fraction_heads(N = 100)
```

```
[1] 0.43
```

---

## Creating Your Own Functions

### Exercise 1

Create a function called `draw_n_letters()`, which draws `\(N\)` letters at random from the alphabet.


```r
draw_n_letters &lt;- function(num_letters = 5){
  sample(LETTERS, size = num_letters, replace = TRUE)
}

draw_n_letters(num_letters = 10)
```

```
 [1] "D" "T" "K" "Q" "I" "Q" "M" "Q" "T" "A"
```

---

## Creating Your Own Functions

### Exercise 2

Create a function called `count_Q()`, which draws `\(N\)` letters from the alphabet at random and counts the number of Q's.

--


```r
count_Q &lt;- function(num_letters = 5){
  
  # draw n letters
  sample_letters &lt;- draw_n_letters(num_letters)
  
  # return the number of Q's
  sum(sample_letters == 'Q')
}

count_Q(100)
```

```
[1] 4
```

## Back to the Trick Coin Problem

---

## The Trick Coin Problem

We can solve this now. We have the technology.

--


```r
fraction_heads(N = 100)
```

```
[1] 0.48
```

--

Let's repeat that 100,000 times and see how often you get 65% heads.

--


```r
# Flip a coin 100 times and count the fraction of heads. 
# Repeat that 100,000 times and save the results
results &lt;- replicate(100000, fraction_heads(N = 100))
```

???

TODO: Questioning lifecycle ; okay here's the approach:
create functions to draw the variable, compute the summary statistic, and replicate the heck out of it. Histogram that distribution.

---

## The Trick Coin Problem


```r
tibble(results) %&gt;% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=results), color = 'black', 
                 binwidth = 0.01) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.65, color = 'red') +
  labs(x = 'Fraction Heads in 100 Fair Coin Flips',
       y = 'Count')
```

## The Trick Coin Problem

Compute p-value.

By the way, that's called the **binomial** distribution. Sum of a bunch of Bernoulli random variables.

## So What?

---

## The Polling Problem



---

class: center, middle

## Expected Value

---

## Expected Value

The **expected value** is the average value of a random variable `\(X\)`.

- Specifically, a *weighted average* of all possible outcomes times their probability.

Discrete: 
`$$E(X) = \sum_x x f(x)$$`

Continuous:
`$$E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x f(x)dx$$`

---

## Expected Value

Suppose `\(X\)` is distributed as follows:

`\(P(X = 0) = 1-p\)` and `\(P(X = 1) = p\)`

What is `\(E(X)\)`?

--

`$$E(X) = 0(1-p) + 1p = p$$`
--

(This is called the Bernoulli Distribution)

---

class: center, middle

## The Law of Large Numbers

If repeatedly draw a random variable a **large number of times**, the average draw will converge on the expected value.

---

## The Law of Large Numbers

If repeatedly draw a random variable a **large number of times**, the average draw will converge on the expected value.

--

**Example:** If you flip a coin 2 million times, roughly how many will be heads?

--

Yep, about 1 million.

---

## Let's Prove It



---

## Monte Carlo

Draw a bunch of samples and compute statistic:


```r
Q &lt;- replicate(10000, count_Q(1000))

tibble(Q) %&gt;% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Q, y = ..density..), color = 'black', binwidth = 3) +
  labs(x = 'Number of Qs in a Random String of Size 1000',
       y = 'Probability') +
  theme_bw()
```
