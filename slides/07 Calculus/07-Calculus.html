# Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

--

- Find the slope of a function at any point

--

- Identify the *minimum* or *maximum* value of a function

--


- Compute the area under a curve

--

- Explain the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus



???

- Optimization is central to game theory, statistical estimation. So much of mathematical social science is maximizing a value function or minimizing a cost function.
- When we get to inference and hypothesis testing, we'll need to know how to take the area under a probability distribution function.
- And the FOTC is just cool.

# Slopes

# Linear Functions

&lt;!-- `\(y = ax + b\)` --&gt;

&lt;img src="07-Calculus_files/figure-html/Plot Linear Function-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

# Linear Functions

Find the slope of each function:

- `\(y = 2x + 4\)`

- `\(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 2\)`

- life expectancy (years) = 18.09359 + 5.737335 `\(\times\)` log(GDP per capita)


--

### Remember:

Slope of a line `\(= \frac{rise}{run}\)` 

--
`\(= \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}\)`

--
`\(= \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\)`


???

Finding the slope of a line is *easy*.

Just wanted you to get comfortable with that last expression, because we'll be see it again in a moment.

# Nonlinear Functions

.center[
&lt;img src="07-Calculus_files/figure-html/Nonlinear Function-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

???

Nonlinear functions are confusing and scary. Sometimes the slope is positive. Sometimes it's negative. Sometimes it's zero. And unlike with linear functions, just looking at the formula gives you no indication what the slope is at any point.

# Isaac Newton

![](img/newton.png)

???

Developed/Discovered:
- The theory of universal gravitation
- Three Laws of Motion
- The Nature of Light
- And, as a side project so he'd have mathematical notation for those other projects, he created calculus

NB: Newton did some of his best work while stuck at home during an epidemic. So, you know, get to it.

---

# Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz


&lt;img src="img/leibniz.jpg" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

Also invented calculus, but with better notation. A philosophical optimist who believed we lived in the "best of all possible worlds", a sentiment parodied by Voltaire, and perhaps belied by the fact that Newton took all the credit for inventing calculus. 

---

# Newton and Leibniz's Insight

Any curve becomes a straight line if you "zoom in" far enough.

&lt;img src="07-Calculus_files/figure-html/Zoom and Enhance 6-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

It's basically a straight line! And finding the slope of a straight line is easy...

???

The point is that, in the limit, as you shrink the interval smaller and smaller (infinitesimally small), the function is better and better approximated by a straight line. And we already know the slope of a straight line, so the problem is solved! (That line is called the tangent line FYI.)

---

# Putting All That Into Math...

.center[
`$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$`
]

--

In English, the slope of a function at point `\(x\)` equals:

- "Rise" `\(f(x+h) - f(x)\)`...

--

- divided by "run" `\((h)\)`...

--

- as `\(h\)` shrinks to zero `\((\lim_{h \to 0})\)`.

--

This is called the **derivative** of a function.

---

# Example

Let `\(f(x) = 2x + 3\)`. What is `\(f'(x)\)`?

--

`$$f'(x) =  \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$` 
--

`$$= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{2(x+h)+3-(2x+3)}{h}$$` 

--

`$$= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{2x+2h+3-(2x+3)}{h}$$`

--

`$$= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{2h}{h}$$`

--

`$$= 2$$`

???

Hey look what we discovered! The slope of a linear function equals the coefficient on `\(x\)`!

---

# Now You Try One

Let `\(f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 3\)`. What is `\(f'(x)\)`?



---

# Solution

&lt;img src="07-Calculus_files/figure-html/Derivative Exercise Solution-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

This function, `\(f'(x)\)`, outputs the slope of `\(f(x)\)` at every point. You can "read off" the slope of `\(f(x)\)` from the vertical of `\(f'(x)\)`.

---

If `\(f(x) = 3x^2+2x+3\)`, then `\(f'(x) = 6x + 2\)`

--

Hey you've discovered a bunch of derivative rules!

--

### Rule 1: The Power Rule

If `\(f(x) = ax^k\)`, then `\(f'(x) = kax^{k-1}\)`

--

### Rule 2: The derivative of a sum is equal to the sum of derivatives

If `\(f(x) = g(x) + h(x)\)`, then `\(f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x)\)`

--

### Rule 3: The derivative of a constant is zero

If `\(f(x) = c\)`, then `\(f'(x) = 0\)`

--

The good news is that mathematicians have discovered a whole bunch of other ones, so we don't have to duplicate their work.

# Don't Freak Out

If you haven't seen these before, it's a lot to absorb. But practice helps.

---

# Here. Practice.

### Problem 1: Power Rule

Let `\(f(x) = 2x^3 + 4x + 79\)`. What is `\(f'(x)\)`?

### Problem 2: Product Rule

Let `\(f(x) = (x^2 + 1)(x+3)\)`. What is `\(f'(x)\)`?

### Problem 3: Quotient Rule

Let `\(f(x) = \frac{2x+1}{x^2}\)`. What is `\(f'(x)\)`?

# Optimization

Let `\(f(x) = 2x^2 + 8x - 32\)`. At what value of `\(x\)` is the function minimized?

&lt;img src="07-Calculus_files/figure-html/Optimization Function-1.png" width="500" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

**Key Insight**: Function is minimized when the slope "switches" from decreasing to increasing. Exactly at the point where the slope equals zero.

---

# Optimization in Three Steps

--

#### 1. Take the derivative of the function.

--

#### 2. Set it equal to zero.

--

#### 3. Solve for `\(x\)`.

---

# Optimization in Three Steps

#### 1. Take the derivative of the function.

--

`$$f(x) = 2x^2 + 8x - 32$$`

--

`$$f'(x) = 4x + 8$$`

--

#### 2. Set it equal to zero

`$$4x + 8 = 0$$`

--

#### 3. Solve for `\(x\)`.

--

`$$x = -2$$`


???

That second step is called the "First Order Condition", or FOC.

---

# Optimization in Three Steps

&lt;img src="07-Calculus_files/figure-html/Optimization Plot with Solution-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


???

Bonus question: how do you know if it's a maximum or a minimum? Take the second derivative! If it's positive, then the slope is increasing (so it's a minimum). If it's positive, then the slope is decreasing (so it's a maximum).

---

# Now You Try It

Suppose that happiness as a function of jellybeans consumed is `\(h(j) = -\frac{1}{3}j^3 + 81j + 2\)`. How many jellybeans should you eat? (Assume you can only eat a positive number of jellybeans).

# Partial Derivatives


---

# Partial Derivatives

What if you have a multivariable function?

`$$f(x,y) = 2x^2y + xy - 4x + y -6$$`

--

Same procedure! To get the derivative of a function *with respect to* `\(x\)` or `\(y\)`, treat the other variable as a constant.

--

`$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 4yx + y - 4$$`

--

`$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2x^2 + x + 1$$`

---

# Now You Try...

Suppose happiness as a function of jellybeans and Dr. Peppers consumed is

`$$h(j,d) = -\frac{1}{2}j^2 + 400j + 200d - d^2 - 2jd + 2$$`
How many jellybeans should you eat? How many Dr. Peppers should you drink?

--

Intuitively, the `\(-2jd\)` term is an **interaction effect**. The effect of jellybeans on happiness decreases if you also drink a lot of Dr. Peppers. 

---

# Now You Try...

`$$h(j,d) = -\frac{1}{2}j^2 + 400j + 200d - d^2 - 2jd + 2$$`

--

`$$\frac{\partial h}{\partial j} = 400 - j - 2d = 0$$`
--

`$$\frac{\partial h}{\partial j} = 200 - 2d - 2j = 0$$`
--

`$$j = 400 - 2d$$`

`$$d = 100 - j$$`
--

`$$j = 400 - 2(100 - j)$$`
$$ $$

# Integrals

# The Area Under a Curve

Rectangles are easy. `\(A = bh\)`

&lt;img src="07-Calculus_files/figure-html/rectangular area-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# The Area Under a Curve

Curves are harder. We didn't learn this in geometry!


&lt;img src="07-Calculus_files/figure-html/plot curve-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# The Area Under a Curve

 - With derivatives, we approximated the hard thing (slope of a curve) using an easy thing (slope of a line) by zooming in close enough.

--

 - With integrals, we'll use a similar trick.

--

 - We'll approximate the hard thing (area under a curve) using an easy thing (area of a bunch of rectangles) by making the rectangles *really* small.

---

# Riemann Sum

&lt;img src="07-Calculus_files/figure-html/reimann sum-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

As `\(h\)` approaches to zero...

`$$F(x+h) - F(x) \approx f(x) \cdot h$$`

--

Rearranging yields:

`$$f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h}$$`

--

Hey. We've seen that before!

--

`\(f(x) = F'(x)\)`. In other words, `\(F(x)\)` is the *antiderivative* of `\(f(x)\)`.


---

# The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

`$$\int_a^b f(x)dx =  F(b) - F(a)$$`

--

Computing the area under the curve and taking the antiderivative are equivalent operations!

---

# The Area Under a Curve

If `\(f(x) = x\)`, find the area under the curve between `\(x=0\)` and `\(x=4\)`.

&lt;img src="07-Calculus_files/figure-html/plot triangle-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

**Hint**: It's a triangle, so the answer should be 8.

---

# The Area Under a Curve

If `\(f(x) = x\)`, find the area under the curve between `\(x=0\)` and `\(x=4\)`.

Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:

`$$\int_0^4 f(x)dx = F(4) - F(0)$$`
--

`\(F(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + C\)`

--

`\(F(4) - F(0) = \frac{1}{2}\cdot4^2 = 8\)`

---

# Now You Try!

If `\(f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 2\)`, find the area under the curve between `\(x=1\)` and `\(x=3\)`.

--

`$$\int_1^3 f(x)dx = F(3) - F(1)$$`

--

`\(F(x) = \frac{1}{4}x^4 - \frac{2}{3}x^3 + 2x + C\)`

--

`\(F(3) - F(1) = \frac{1}{4}3^4 - \frac{2}{3}3^3 + 2(3) - [\frac{1}{4}1^4 - \frac{2}{3}1^3 + 2(1)]\)`

--
`\(= 6 \frac{2}{3}\)`
