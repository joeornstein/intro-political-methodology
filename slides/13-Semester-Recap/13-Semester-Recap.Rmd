# Week 1: R

`R` is a powerful, all-purpose calculator:

```{r}
(2 + 2)^2 * 2 + 4
```

--

Save information to short-term memory as **objects**:

```{r}
x <- (2 + 2)^2 * 2 + 4
```

--

Use objects as inputs to **functions**:

```{r}
sqrt(x)

x %>% sqrt
```

???

Objects are "nouns", functions are "verbs".

# Week 1: R

A **vector** is an ordered set of values.

```{r}
x <- c(1,3,2,6,2)

x
```

--

A **matrix** is an ordered set of vectors. **Tidy data** is a matrix with row vectors of observations and column vectors of variables:

# Week 1: R

A **statistic** is a value computed from data.

```{r}
mean(x) # sum(x) / n

median(x) # the middle value

var(x) # average squared distance to the mean

sd(x) # square root of variance
```

# Week 2: Visualizing Data

To build a `ggplot` object, we successively add **layers**, mapping those layers to vectors in a dataset.

```{r}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = mtcars) + 
  # add points
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=wt, y=mpg, 
                           color = factor(cyl))) +
  # add a line of best fit
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=wt, y=mpg),
              method = 'lm', se = FALSE, color = 'red') +
  # add labels
  labs(x = 'Weight', y = 'Miles Per Gallon',
       title = 'Some Old Cars', color = 'Cylinders') +
  # add a theme
  theme_classic(base_size = 16)
```

# Week 2: Visualizing Data

To build a `ggplot` object, we successively add **layers**, mapping those layers to vectors in a dataset.

```{r, out.width='70%'}
plot1
```

???

In this fashion, we can build up whatever visualization we want!
