## Why Look At Data?

 1. To understand it ourselves! This is the most skipped step, and that's crazy. (See Anscombe's Quartet, also the dinosaur)
 2. To memorably, effectively communicate our findings. (Fact is, this is how *most* readers will be reading your paper).

## What makes an effective visualization?

Plenty of disagreement, but some core principles include:

 1. Easy to interpret at a glance, (self-explanatory without a big caption); be kind to the reader
 2. Efficiently convey information (Tufte admonishes us to maximize the "data-to-ink ratio" and eliminate "chartjunk")

[It] is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space
