1. Something's going on with the Feeling Thermometers
 - mean(harris, biden, buttigieg)
 - histogram
 - filter

2. How do *Democrats* feel about Harris, Biden, Buttigieg? Facet by votedem20
 - clean up votedem20
 - demonstrate xlab(), themes
 - cleaning up votedem20 in fig2_data doesn't clean it up in `data`

<Now you try! Use an FT for a different candidate>

 3. Other options for plotting distributions
  - boxplot
  - jitter, demonstrate color, alpha
  - violin

4. Plotting relationships between two variables: scatter plots
 - ftharris vs. ftbiden
 - you can facet that too.
 - color points by another variable?

<Now you try! Scatter two feeling thermometers of your choice>

5. Working with categorical variables
 - Liveurban barplot
 - Clean up Liveurban
 - facet by youthurban
 - jitter liveurban & youthurban

 < Now you try! Pick three categorical variables, clean them up, and find a useful way to display their relationship >
