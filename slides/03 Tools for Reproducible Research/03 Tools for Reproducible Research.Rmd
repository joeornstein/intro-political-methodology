# Three Tools

1. Reproducible Reports (`RMarkdown`)

2. Version Control (`git` and `GitHub`)

3. Citation Management (Zotero, Meneley, perma.cc)

There are others, but this will get you started...

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## The Typical Academic's Version Control System

**Problems:**

- It's a psychic nightmare.
- Which is the most recent copy of the paper? `paper_VERSION2_RAH_EDITS` or `paper_VERSION2_JTO_EDITS`?
- All those copies waste memory.
- What's up with the directory structure? Why is some data outside of the `data/` folder?

## Actual Version Control System (VCS)

Picture of GitHub

- Requires an initial investment to learn, but it's **WORTH IT**.

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```
