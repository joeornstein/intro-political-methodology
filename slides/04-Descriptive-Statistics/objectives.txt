Statistics is the plural of *statistic*. What is a *statistic*?
 - A **statistic** is a quantity computed from data. We use statistics to describe the world and make inferences.

Two purposes:
  1. Describe the sample we have
  2. Make inferences about the broader population (this in a few weeks)

In stylized terms
Data -> Function -> Statistic



Two step process:
 - Get the data object into an appropriate form
 - Apply a function (or series of functions) to compute statistics

Today, we learn how to wrangle datasets so we can compute statistics.
 - Objects
 - Functions


Understand and compute standard descriptive statistics:
 - Mean, median, mode
 - Variance, standard deviation
 - Covariance, correlation
 - Sample size
 - Proportions
 - Kurtosis / skewness?
 - Quartiles, interquartile range

 Use tidyverse package to clean, merge, and transform datasets

  - Merge functions
  - summarize()
  - group_by()
  - mutate()
  - if_else()
  - select()
  - Pipes: %>%

Some basic programming:

 - loops
 - if/else
 - indentation
 - writing your own functions
