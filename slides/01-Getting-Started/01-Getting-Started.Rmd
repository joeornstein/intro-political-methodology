# What Are We Doing Here?

---

# What Are We Doing Here?

--

Modern political science is full of data analysis and mathematical thinking. You'll want to speak the language.

--

### By the end of this course, you will be able to...

--

 - "Wrangle" and summarize data

--

 - Construct elegant and informative data visualizations
 
--

 - Distinguish between patterns in data and random noise (**probability** and **inference**)
 
--

 - Build models and conveniently represent data using **matrix algebra**

--

 - Optimize objective functions using **calculus**
 


???

No matter your subfield or approach to political science, chances are you'll find it useful to be able to analyze data. You'll certainly find it useful to understand what other people are doing when they use mathetmatical / computational techniques in their research.

In political science, we don't only seek to describe our datasets, but to *understand* and *explain* them. And for that you'll need some mathematical tools.

# `R`


---

# What is R?

R is a programming language specifically designed for statistical computing.

--

It is widely used in academia and the data science community. By some measures it is the [8th most popular programming language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

???

That's out of *all programming languages*, including whatever they use to make Bejeweled.

---

# Why use R?

**Major Alternatives**: Microsoft Excel, Stata, SPSS, SAS, Python

--

*Short Answer*: 

 - I use R and I'm comfortable teaching it.

--

*Long Answer*:

- It's free
- It's open-source
- It's reproducible
- It has a huge user community building useful packages (add-ons)
- In academic social science, R is now fairly predominant (particularly among younger cohorts)
- It has a shorter learning curve than Python

???

- So many research bungles come from non-reproducible analyses in Excel or point-and-click workflows in Stata/SPSS/SAS. More on reproducibility in a few weeks.
- Python is a good choice too, and very popular in the data science world. If you want to become a professional data scientist, definitely learn Python too! But for our purposes, it's a bit much. Python is a *general-purpose* programming language. It can do so much more than statistical analysis. And so getting it set up / learning the basics takes a bit longer. It's like teaching you to fly a Boeing 737 when all you really want to do is learn how to drive a car. Sure, if you can pilot an aircraft, you'd probably become pretty good at driving too. But when starting out, it's probably easier to just start with the car.

# R Will Be Frustrating

Computers are great at a lot of things, like:

--

- Multiplying large numbers

--

- Following instructions perfectly

--

- Never getting tired or sleepy

--

Computers are *not-so-great* at other things, like: 

--

- Guessing what you really want

# R is a Fancy Calculator


---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

Type `2+2` into the console and press `Enter`.

--

```{r 2+2}
2 + 2
```

--

I basically use R whenever I need a calculator now. 

--

(I Kon-Maried my Texas Instruments TI-83. Thank you, old friend.)

![](img/ti-tetris.gif)

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

#### Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
```{r calculator 1}
2 - 2

2 * 2

2 / 2
```

--

*Note*: whenever you see a **code block** like the ones above, please follow along by typing the code into your R Console! If you don't get the same result as me, stop me and we'll discuss.

???

This is meant to be an interactive practice. The best way to learn how to program is to do it!

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

#### Exponentiation

$2^4 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = ?$

--

```{r calculator 2}
2^4
```

--

Now you try. Compute $3^6$.

--

```{r calculator 3}
3^6
```

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

### Fractional Exponents

Remember what happens when you raise a number to a fractional power? Say, $9^\frac{1}{2}$?

--

```{r fractional exponents}
9^0.5
```

--

$9^\frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{9}$

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

### Fractional Exponents

What is $(4^3)^\frac{1}{3}$?

--

```{r fractional exponents 2}
(4^3)^(1/3)
```

--

**General Rule**: When you have nested exponents like that, you can just multiply the exponents.

```{r more exponents}
(2^3)^6

2^18
```

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

Hey, remember **logarithms**?

--

Subtraction reverses addition. 

$2+3-3=2$

--

Division reverses multiplication.

$2 \times 3 \div 3 = 2$

--

Logarithms reverse exponentiation.

$\log_{3}(3^2) = 2$

--

The subscript is the "base" of the logarithm. When you see $\log_x(y)$, think "how many times do I have to multiply $x$ by itself to get $y$?"

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

What is $\log_{10}(100)$?

--

```{r logarithms 1}
log(100, base = 10)
```

--

Because $10^2 = 100$.

--

What is $\log_2(100)$?

--

```{r logarithms 2}
log(100, base = 2)
```

--

Because $2^6 = 64$ and $2^7 = 128$, so you need to multiply 2 by itself roughly 6.6 times in order to get 100.

--

Weird. I know.

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

### The Nice Thing About Logarithms

--

Logarithms turn multiplication into addition:

$$\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$$

--

And they turn exponentiation into multiplication:

$$\log(a^b) = b \log(a)$$

--

This comes in handy a lot! Basically anytime you see a "log transformation" in political science, we're taking advantage of this fact to make the math easier.

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

Compute `log(342 * 702)` and `log(342) + log(702)`.

--

You should get: 

```{r log multiplication}
log(342 * 702)

log(342) + log(702)
```

--

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

Now try `log(342 ^ 702)` and `702 * log(342)`.

--

You should get: 

```{r log exponents}
log(342 ^ 702)

702 * log(342)
```

--

The first one completely broke R because $342^{702}$ is an unimaginably large number that it can't keep in memory. So, it's useful to know your logarithm rules sometimes. 

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

### Oh Hey

What base does R use when you don't give it a base for the `log` calculation?

--

**Answer:** It uses base $e \approx 2.718$, also known as **Euler's Number**. The logarithm with base $e$ is called the "natural logarithm", also denoted $\ln x$.


--

```{r euler pic, echo = FALSE, out.width='25%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Leonhard_Euler.jpg')
```

That's Leonhard Euler. Don't let the weird towel hat fool you. He was a towering 18th century mathematical genius.

???

$e$ is one of those special, magical mathematical constants that gets its very own letter, like $\pi$. When we get to calculus in a few weeks, it will become clearer why it is so special, but the intution for now is that if you loan me \$1 and I promise to pay you 100% interest compounded *infinitely*, you'll have $e$ dollars in one year. 

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

R respects the **Order of Operations**.

- Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, then Subtraction

--

- (**P**lease **E**xcuse **M**y **D**ear **A**unt **S**ally)

--

Try $\frac{2(3+2)^2 - 2}{3}$

--

$$
\frac{2(3+2)^2 - 2}{3} = \frac{2(5)^2 - 2}{3} = \frac{2(25) - 2}{3} = \frac{50-2}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16
$$
--

Or, in R:

```{r order of operations}
(2*(3+2)^2 - 2)/3
```

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

Finally, R can evaluate **logical expressions**.

--

```{r logical expressions}
2 < 3

2 > 3

2*2 < 4*5

3*4 == 2*6
```


---

# Objects


---

# Objects

--

One of the features that makes R such a *fancy* calculator is the ability to save **objects**.

--

You can assign any value to an object like this:

```{r assignment}
x <- 2
```

--

The left arrow (`<-`) tells R that we want to assign the value 2 to an object named `x`. 

--

Now when you type `x` into the console, R will output the value 2.

```{r return x}
x
```

---

# Objects

You can manipulate objects just like we manipulated numbers.

--

```{r objects in calculations}
2 * x

2 - x^2 * 5
```

---

# Objects

You can give objects whatever names you like, with a few restrictions:

--

- No spaces

- No special mathematical characters, like `-`, `+`, `*`, `/`

- Variable names can include numbers, but must *start* with a letter.

--

Use good names for your objects!

```{r good name}
georgia_population <- 10620000
```

--

This is a bad name:

```{r bad name}
vargp <- 10620000
```

--

I personally use underscores (`_`) if I want to name an object something with multiple words.

---

# Objects

Now you try! Create an object, name it whatever you want, and assign it a number. 

Then create a second object that is two times your first object.

--

```{r object practice}
x <- 10

x_twice <- 2*x

x

x_twice
```

---

# Objects

Objects can also be **characters** instead of numbers. 

--

```{r characters}
my_name <- "Joe"

my_name
```

--

They can also be **booleans**, which is computer-speak for "true or false".

```{r boolean}
i_am_joe <- (my_name == "Joe")
two_plus_two_is_five <- (2 + 2 == 5)

i_am_joe
two_plus_two_is_five
```

# Functions


---

# Functions

A **function** transforms one or more inputs into an output. 

```{r function figure, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/function.png')
```

--

$f(x) = 2x + 2$

--

$f(2) = ?$

---

# Functions

You've already seen some built-in R functions, for example:

`log(x, base)`

--

The `log()` function takes two inputs, a number `x` and a value for `base`, and outputs the logarithm.

--

R functions almost always come in this form: a name followed by one or more inputs in parentheses, separated by commas.

---

# Functions

What does the `round()` function do? What about the `paste()` function?

--

```{r round}
round(3.4)
round(3.6)
```

--

```{r paste}
paste("Hi", "my name is", my_name)
```

--

There are *lots* of built-in and user-created functions for R. If you ever want to know what a function does, type `?` + the name of the function in the console. 

```{r help, eval = FALSE}
?log
```

---

# Functions

You can also make your own functions, like this:

```{r custom function}
my_function <- function(x, y){
  return(2*x + y^2 - 2)
}
```

--

```{r custom function 2}
my_function(x = 4, y = 6)
```

--

This is **super** helpful when writing lots of repetitious code. More on this in a few weeks.

--

### Now you try! 

Write a function called `round_the_log` which takes a number, finds the natural logarithm, and rounds it to the nearest whole number.

???

Since you'll need multiple lines of code, try out the Code Editor.

---

# Functions

### Now you try!

Write a function called `round_the_log` which inputs a number `x`, and returns the natural logarithm rounded to the nearest whole number.

--

```{r round_the_log}
round_the_log <- function(x){
  return(round(log(x)))
}
```

--

```{r round_the_log 2}
round_the_log(42)
```

# Data!

--

![](img/data-yes.gif)

---

# Data

--

### 1. Vectors

A **vector** is a collection of values arranged in some order. Vectors are the building blocks of datasets. 

--

For example, this is the vector $\bf{x}$.

$\bf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$

--

We build vectors in R using the function `c()`, which is short for **concatenate**.

```{r c()}
x <- c(1,3,4)

x
```

---

# Data

### 1. Vectors

You can retrieve the elements of a vector using brackets `[]`.

--

```{r retrieve vector elements}
x

x[1]

x[2]

x[2:3]
```

---

# Data

### 1. Vectors

--

If you've never seen vectors before, don't worry. They basically operate how you would expect a bunch of numbers squished together to operate.

--

.pull-left[
### Adding Vectors

$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}$

```{r vector addition}
x <- c(1,3,4)
y <- c(3,2,2)

x + y
```

]

--

.pull-right[
### Scalar Multiplication

$2 \times \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}$

```{r scalar multiplication}
x <- c(1,3,4)

2*x
```

]

---

# Data

### 1. Vectors

Many R functions are **vectorized**. If you input a vector, it evaluates the function for each element of the vector.

--

```{r vectorized functions}
x <- c(3.4, 3.5, 3.6)

round(x)

log(x)

round_the_log(x)
```

---

# Data

### 1. Vectors

Other functions input a vector and return a single value. 

--

Suppose you have a vector $x$ representing the number of Democratic votes cast in a collection of counties.

```{r summary statistics}
democratic_votes <- c(1562, 2890, 49134, 18, 901)
```

--

If you want to know how many entries are in the vector, use `length()`.

```{r length function}
length(democratic_votes)
```

---

# Data

### 1. Vectors

To get the **minimum** and **maximum** values in a vector, use the `min()` and `max()` functions.

--

```{r min and max}
min(democratic_votes)

max(democratic_votes)
```

---

# Data

### 1. Vectors

Maybe you want to take the sum across all counties:

$$
\sum_i x_i
$$

--

Use the `sum()` function.

```{r sum function}
sum(democratic_votes)
```

---

# Data

### 1. Vectors

Maybe you want the **mean** (average) value, the sum divided by the length.

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_i x_i}{n}
$$
--

Use the `mean()` function.

```{r mean function}
mean(democratic_votes)
```

--

Now try to take the `sum()` divided by the `length()`. Do you get the same result?

--

```{r mean function 2}
sum(democratic_votes) / length(democratic_votes)
```

---

# Data

### 1. Vectors

The **median** is the value right in the middle of a vector sorted from least to greatest.

--

```{r median}
democratic_votes
```

--

```{r median 2}
median(democratic_votes)

sort(democratic_votes)
```

---

# Data

### 1. Vectors

The **variance** of a vector measures how far values tend to be from the mean. It is a measure of *dispersion*.

--

Variance equals the average *squared* distance from the mean.

$$
\sigma^2_x = \frac{\sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}
$$

--

You can compute variance in R with the `var()` function.

```{r var function}
var(democratic_votes)
```

???

We use squares so that positives and negatives don't cancel out. Also it makes the calculus nice. 

---

# Data

### 1. Vectors

Which of these vectors has a smaller variance?

```{r var comparison}
x <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

y <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

--

```{r var comparison 2}
var(x)
var(y)
```

---

# Data

### 1. Vectors

The square root of variance is the **standard deviation**.

$$
\sigma_x = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}}
$$

--

```{r sd function}
sd(democratic_votes)
```



---

# Data

### 2. Matrices

--

A **matrix** (the plural is **matrices**) is a bunch of vectors smushed together.

$$
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
3 & 1 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
B = 
\begin{bmatrix}
3.2 & 1 & 7\\
9 & 8 & 42\\
1 & 12 & \pi
\end{bmatrix}
$$

--

Each row is a vector and so is each column.


---

# Data

### 3. Playing with matrices

To create a matrix in R, we **bind** together a set of vectors using the `rbind()` or `cbind()` functions.

```{r matrices, echo = TRUE}
A <- rbind(c(1, 2, 3), 
           c(2, 1, 3), 
           c(42, 1, pi))

A
```

--

Now you try. Create the matrix `A` again, but this time use `cbind()` to paste the columns together. 

---

# Data

### 3. Playing with matrices

You can retrieve entries in the matrix like so:

--

```{r get matrix entry 1}
A[1,2]
```

--

```{r get matrix entry 2}
A[3,3]
```

--

```{r get matrix entry 3}
A[3,]
```

--

```{r get matrix entry 4}
A[,2]
```


---

# Data

### 4. Tidy Data

Tidy data is a rectangular matrix, arranged like this:

![](img/tidy-1.png)

--

**Unit of Observation**: What does each row represent? 
 - Could be countries, people, "country-years", etc. Just keep it consistent!

---

# Data

### 4. Tidy Data

In R, we represent data using a special object called a `data.frame`. (Or a `tibble`, which I'll show you next week.)

--

```{r data.frame}
height <- c(5.3, 5.8, 4.2)
gender <- c('male', 'male', 'female')
party <- c('R', 'D', 'D')

data <- data.frame(height, gender, party)

data
```

---

# Data

### 4. Tidy Data

You can access columns in a data frame by using `$` + the variable name.

```{r $}
data$height

data$party
```

--

And then you can manipulate it just like any other vector.

```{r data.frame summary statistics}
mean(data$height)
```

# USE THE CODE EDITOR. SERIOUSLY.

--

We've been having a lot of fun typing commands into the console. It's fast. It's easy. It's *addictive*.

--

**NEVER ACTUALLY DO YOUR WORK THERE.**

--

Why?

--

Because go ahead and close your RStudio window. Then reopen it.

--

Go ahead, I'll wait.

--

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH WHAT HAPPENED TO MY WORK??? IT'S GONE! HOW WILL I EVER REMEMBER WHAT I DID TO GET MY RESULT????

--

Don't let this sort of thing happen to you. Use the **Code Editor**.

???

I was once like you are now. Fancy free. Typing all of my commands into the console. When I was a research assistant right out of college, I did an entire data analysis and made a nice chart right from the console. Showed it to the Fellow I was working with. She said "looks great! could you make a few changes?" Um....no?

# Writing R Scripts

---

# Writing R Scripts

--

An **R script** is a series of commands that you can save, modify, and re-run whenever you like.

--

```{r example script}
x <- c(1, 3, 4)

y <- mean(x)

z <- median(x)

y < z
```

The four lines of code above:
 - Creates a vector called `x`
 - Compute the mean and median of `x`
 - Tells you if the mean is smaller than the median
 
--

Copy all that into the Code Editor.

---

# Writing R Scripts

--

- To run the entire script, type `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`

--

- To run a single line in the script, click on the line and type `Ctrl + Enter`

--

- To save a script, type `Ctrl + S`. The file extension is `.R`

---

# Commenting Your Code

Just plain code can be hard to read. If someone else (or a future version of you) tries to read this, it may not be obvious what the code does or why.

```{r example script without comments, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1, 3, 4)

y <- mean(x)

z <- median(x)

y < z
```

---

# Commenting Your Code

**Comments** make code easier to read. Insert a comment with `#`.

```{r example script with comments, eval = FALSE}
# This script creates a vector of data and returns TRUE if the mean is smaller than the median
# Author: Joe Ornstein
# Version: 1.0
# Date: August 26, 2020

# Create the vector
x <- c(1, 3, 4)

# Compute the mean
y <- mean(x)

# Compute the median
z <- median(x)

# Compare the mean and median with a logical expression
y < z
```

---

# Now You Try!

Create, comment, and save an R script that does the following:

1. Create an object called `GDP` and assign it a vector of numbers (whatever numbers you like). 

2. Create an object called `population` and assign it a vector of numbers. Make sure it is the same length as `GDP`. 

3. Create an object called `GDP_per_capita`, which is GDP divided by population.

4. Put all three vectors into a `data.frame` called `data`.

5. Compute the mean and standard deviation of GDP per capita.
