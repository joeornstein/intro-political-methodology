Note about objects in Environment Pane

Two Common Sticking Points:

 - Parentheses
 - Quotation Marks

They're very special in R. Parentheses mean a function, and quotation marks mean a character (distinguish from an object)

x <- 2
print(x)
print("x")

Double or single quotes are okay; just be consistent, and make sure that there are quotes at the beginning and end of your character.

Parentheses hold the inputs to functions. Make sure your list of inputs starts with a ( and ends with a ). If you nest multiple functions (you wil), make sure all of your parentheses match up.

Exercise:

What's wrong with this code?

```{r eval = FALSE}
print(paste("The dog", "ate', x, 'bananas')
```


For problem set 1:

rename the ANES dataset to anes, so it's not confusing that the dataset is named "data". Should be clear that it's an object.
