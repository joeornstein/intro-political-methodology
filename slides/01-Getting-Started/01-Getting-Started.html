# `R`


---

# What is R?

R is a programming language specifically designed for statistical computing.

--

It is widely used in academia and data science communities. By some measures it is the [8th most popular programming language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

???

That's out of *all programming languages*, including whatever they use to make Bejeweled.

---

# Why use R?

**Major Alternatives**: Microsoft Excel, Stata, SPSS, SAS, Python

--

*Short Answer*: 

 - I use R and I'm comfortable teaching it.

--

*Long Answer*:

- It's free
- It's open-source
- It's reproducible
- It has a huge user community building useful packages (add-ons)
- In academic social science, R is now fairly predominant (particularly among younger cohorts)
- It has a shorter learning curve than Python

???

- So many research bungles come from non-reproducible analyses in Excel or point-and-click workflows in Stata/SPSS/SAS. More on reproducibility in a few weeks.
- Python is a good choice too, and very popular in the data science world. If you want to become a professional data scientist, definitely learn Python too! But for our purposes, it's a bit much. Python is a *general-purpose* programming language. It can do so much more than statistical analysis. And so getting it set up / learning the basics takes a bit longer. It's like teaching you to fly a Boeing 737 when all you really want to do is learn how to drive a car. Sure, if you can pilot an aircraft, you'd probably become pretty good at driving too. But when starting out, it's probably easier to just start with the car.

# Download R

Here (click the picture):

[![](img/download-r.png)](https://cloud.r-project.org/)


---

# Download R

You could stop there, and work with R in this nice black terminal box...

&lt;img src="img/rterm.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

...or we could use an IDE (integrated development environment) called RStudio.

---

# Download RStudio

# R is a Fancy Calculator


---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

Type `2+2` into the console.

--


```r
2 + 2
```

```
[1] 4
```

--

I basically use R whenever I need a calculator now. 

--

(I Kon-Maried my Texas Instruments TI-83. Thank you, old friend.)

# R is a Fancy Calculator

#### Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division

```r
2 - 2
```

```
[1] 0
```

```r
2 * 2
```

```
[1] 4
```

```r
2 / 2
```

```
[1] 1
```

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

#### Exponentiation

`\(2^4 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = ?\)`

--


```r
2^4
```

```
[1] 16
```

--

Now you try. Compute `\(3^6\)`.

--


```r
3^6
```

```
[1] 729
```

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

### Fractional Exponents

Remember what happens when you raise a number to a fractional power? Say, `\(9^\frac{1}{2}\)`?

--


```r
9^0.5
```

```
[1] 3
```

--

`\(9^\frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{9}\)`

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

### Fractional Exponents

What is `\((4^3)^\frac{1}{3}\)`?

--


```r
(4^3)^(1/3)
```

```
[1] 4
```

--

**General Rule**: When you have nested exponents like that, you can just multiply the exponents.


```r
(2^3)^6
```

```
[1] 262144
```

```r
2^18
```

```
[1] 262144
```

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

Hey, remember logarithms?

--

### Logarithms

Subtraction reverses addition. 

`\(2+3-3=2\)`

--

Division reverses multiplication.

`\(2 \times 3 \div 3 = 2\)`

--

Logarithms reverse exponentiation.

`\(\log_{3}(3^2) = 2\)`

--

The subscript is the "base" of the logarithm. When you see `\(\log_x(y)\)`, think "how many times do I have to multiply `\(x\)` by itself to get `\(y\)`? 

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

What is `\(\log_{10}(100)\)`?

--


```r
log(100, base = 10)
```

```
[1] 2
```

--

Because `\(10^2 = 100\)`.

--

What is `\(\log_2(100)\)`?

--


```r
log(100, base = 2)
```

```
[1] 6.643856
```

--

Because `\(2^6 = 64\)` and `\(2^7 = 128\)`, so you need to multiply 2 by itself roughly 6.6 times in order to get 100.

--

Weird. I know.

---

# R is a Fancy Calculator

R respects the **Order of Operations**.

- Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, then Subtraction

--

- (**P**lease **E**xcuse **M**y **D**ear **A**unt **S**ally)

--

Try `\(\frac{2(3+2)^2 - 2}{3}\)`

--

$$
\frac{2(3+2)^2 - 2}{3} = \frac{2(5)^2 - 2}{3} = \frac{2(25) - 2}{3} = \frac{50-2}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16
$$
--

Or, in R:


```r
(2*(3+2)^2 - 2)/3
```

```
[1] 16
```

# Functions

A **function** transforms an input into an output. 

&lt;img src="img/function.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

`\(f(x) = 2x + 2\)`

--

`\(f(2) = ?\)`

Hey while we're talking about functions, remember the properties of functions?

### Adding Vectors

`\(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}\)`


```r
x &lt;- c(1,3,4)
y &lt;- c(3,2,2)

x + y
```

```
[1] 4 5 6
```

]

.pull-right[
### Scalar Multiplication

`\(2 \times \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}\)`


```r
x &lt;- c(1,3,4)

2*x

# Matrices

A **matrix** (the plural is **matrices**) is a bunch of vectors smushed together.

$$
A = 
`\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\
3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{bmatrix}`
$$

$$
B = 
`\begin{bmatrix}
3.2 &amp; 1 &amp; 7\\
9 &amp; 8 &amp; 42\\
1 &amp; 12 &amp; \pi
\end{bmatrix}`
$$

--

Each row is a vector and so is each column.


---

# Let's Play with Matrices

To create a matrix in R, we **bind** together a set of vectors using the `rbind()` or `cbind()` functions.


```r
A &lt;- rbind(c(1, 2, 3), 
           c(2, 1, 3), 
           c(42, 1, pi))

A
```

```
     [,1] [,2]     [,3]
[1,]    1    2 3.000000
[2,]    2    1 3.000000
[3,]   42    1 3.141593
```

--

Now you try. Create the matrix `A` again, but this time use `cbind()` to paste the columns together. 

---

# Let's Play with Matrices

Get entries in the matrix like so:

--


```r
A[1,2]
```

```
[1] 2
```

--


```r
A[3,3]
```

```
[1] 3.141593
```

--


```r
A[3,] # the third row
```

```
[1] 42.000000  1.000000  3.141593
```

--


```r
A[,2] # the second column
```

```
[1] 2 1 1
```


---


# Tidy Data

Tidy data is a rectangular matrix, arranged like this:

**Unit of Observation**: What are the rows? 
 - Could be countries, people, "country-years", etc. Just keep it consistent!

# USE THE CODE EDITOR. SERIOUSLY.

--

We've been having a lot of fun typing commands into the console. It's fast, easy...addictive.

--

**NEVER ACTUALLY DO YOUR WORK THERE.**

--

Why?

--

Because go ahead and close your RStudio window. Then reopen it.

--

Go ahead, I'll wait.

--

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH WHAT HAPPENED TO MY WORK??? IT'S GONE! HOW WILL I EVER REMEMBER WHAT I DID TO GET MY RESULT????

--

Don't let this sort of thing happen to you. Use the **Code Editor**.

???

I was once like you are now. Fancy free. Typing all of my commands into the console. When I was a research assistant right out of college, I did an entire data analysis and made a nice chart right from the console. Showed it to the Fellow I was working with. She said "looks great! could you make a few changes?" Um....no?
