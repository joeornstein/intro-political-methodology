## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(babynames)
library(tidyverse)

babynames |> 
  filter(name == 'Joseph',
         sex == 'M') |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=year,
                       y=prop)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = 'Year',
       y = 'Proportion of Babies Born',
       title = 'All The American Joes')
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
