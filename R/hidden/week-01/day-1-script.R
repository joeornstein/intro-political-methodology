# this line of code adds two and two
2 + 2

# R observes order of operations (PEMDAS)
2 + 2 * 3

3 * 2 + 2

3 + 2 / 2^2

(3 + 2) * 5


# to create an object, use left arrow
number <- 3.5

# once the object is saved, you can do arithmetic on it
number - 3

# you can change the value assigned to the object
# the same way you created it
number <- 4

# objects can be characters too! just surround with
# quotation marks
x <- "summer squash"
y <- "is delicious"

# functions are the "verbs" of the programming language
# take one or more inputs inside parentheses, 
# separated by commas
paste(x, y)

# you can then save the output of function to new objects
full_sentence <- paste(x, y)
