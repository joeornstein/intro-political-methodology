This week we discuss the challenges involved in making inferences about a population based on an observed sample. By the end of this week, you will be able to:

-   Describe the conditions under which a sample is representative of a population of interest, and the challenges involved in obtaining a representative sample.

-   Compute and interpret a variety of summary statistics from data, including frequency tables, median, variance, standard deviation, covariance, and correlation coefficient.

-   Produce basic data visualizations like histograms and scatter plots.
