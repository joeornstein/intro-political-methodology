## Measurement

Scientific theories often involve concepts and ideas that we cannot observe directly with our senses. Political scientists in particular are interested in nebulous concepts like *democracy*, *polarization*, *freedom*, *ideology*, *representation*, *warfare*, *alliances*, and countless other ideas that lack clear, objective standards for categorization and measurement. But if we want to test our theories against evidence, we can't just , we need a consistent way to measure these concepts,

"[I know it when I see it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it)" may be that . Even relatively straightforward concepts like require us to *ask human beings questions*, and

One can think of these three fundamental problems as three different kinds of *missing data problems*---whether it's a latent characteristic, a counterfactual, or observations not included in your dataset---there is some information that we cannot observe directly, and we have to predict what it might be on the basis of the information we do observe.

-   @gelmanRegressionOtherStories2021 is a bit more advanced than the content we cover in POLS 7012, but chapters 1 and 2 helped motivate the "three challenges of statistics" ([website](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/)).

-   @berinskyMeasuringPublicOpinion2017 is a nice overview of the challenges of measuring public opinion using polls, emphasizing that *who we ask* and *what we ask* are equally important considerations.

-   @bradleyUnrepresentativeBigSurveys2021 is a beautiful exploration of the "Paradox of Big Data", demonstrating why *large* samples are not necessarily *better* samples.

-   See the [Rubin Causal Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_causal_model) for a more detailed discussion of the potential outcomes framework and the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference.
