Last week, we introduced probability theory from the perspective of *sampling*. We have some population of interest, and we imagine all the possible samples that we could draw from the population. With this sampling distribution in hand, we have a better sense of how far from the truth a sample estimate might be.

This week, we turn that question on its head. We are no longer an omniscient being who can sample *ad infinitum* from the population. Instead, we are a humble researcher with a single sample. What conclusions can we draw? How confident are we that our sample is not way out in the tails of the sampling distribution? That is a task for *statistical inference*.

## Reading Assignments

-   @kellstedt2018, chapters 7-8 (Statistical Inference and Bivariate Hypothesis Testing)[^1]

-   [There Is Only One Test](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2016/06/there-is-still-only-one-test.html) (blog post by Allen Downey)

[^1]: If you're taking POLS 7010, then I assume you have this book. If not, you may borrow it from others in the class or from me. Or buy it, I guess. It's a good book.
