Hello! Welcome to our class website.

## Getting Started

There is a *lot* of software to install for this class, but in the instructions below I've tried to make it as straightforward as possible. (And everything is free!) Before the end of our first week, please complete the following steps.

### Data Analysis: R and RStudio

For starters, you will need `R`. The most current version is available [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/). To download, click link for your operating system (i.e. Mac, Windows, Linux), then follow the instructions on the page.

`R` is the programming language itself, but it comes with a pretty unfriendly interface.

You don't want to do all your typing in that lonely black box. Instead, you want **RStudio**, a piece of software that makes `R` *much* prettier. Download the RStudio Desktop version [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

### Version Control: git

Professional coders use a **version control system** called `git` to keep track of their code. If you're on a Mac, skip this section. Your machine already has it installed.[^1] If you use a PC, follow the installation instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

[^1]: I think? If you're on a Mac and you can't get git to work, let me know!

Using `git` to track changes in your code involves a bit of struggle on the front end, but it is well worth it [@bryan2017]. I'll walk you through the basics in class.

### Reference Management: Zotero

This software makes it blindingly simple to keep track of and format your citations. It also plays really nicely with RStudio. Download it [here](<https://www.zotero.org/>) and follow the setup instructions. The [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zotero-connector/ekhagklcjbdpajgpjgmbionohlpdbjgc?hl=en) is particularly useful; anything you find on the Internet can be saved to your library with one click.

### Social Annotation: Hypothesis

This semester, we'll be using a **social annotation** platform called [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/). That way, everyone will be able to post comments/questions/concerns/memes directly into the reading assignments. Follow these steps to get started:

1.  Click the book icon in the top-right corner of the course website. This will take you to our [Hypothesis Group Page](https://hypothes.is/groups/oEioeZW4/pols-3230-fall-2021).
2.  If you don't already have an account, you will be prompted to create one. Make your username something like `firstname_lastname` so we know who is posting!
3.  Hypothesis works best with Google Chrome. If you don't have it, install it [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
4.  Install the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek?hl=en). When you do, it should take you to a welcome page with instructions on how to log in, pin the extension, and start annotating pages!

5.  Go to the [syllabus](syllabus/POLS-3230-syllabus.pdf) and add your questions/comments/memes. Whenever you annotate a reading, just make sure that you are posting to the Group instead of Public (see the dropdown menu at the top of the extension).

### Memory Aid: Anki

Take 20 minutes and play through @case2018. If you're convinced, download [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). It's not the prettiest spaced repetition software out there, but it is free, streamlined, highly customizable, and has a large, dedicated fanbase.

### Note-Taking Software (Optional)

While we're talking software, consider how you want to organize all the notes you generate in grad school. Information is going to be coming at you like a firehouse, and you'll want a system that you can trust as your "external brain".[^2] I highly recommend reading @ahrens2017, a book that is much more fascinating than a book about note-taking should rightfully be.

[^2]: Don't be like I was in grad school and write all your notes in a bunch of random notebooks that you throw in the trash at the end of the semester; so much wasted effort!
