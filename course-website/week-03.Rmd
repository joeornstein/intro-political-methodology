- I'm assigning what I think are the crucial chapters of R4DS, but if you really want to get deep into `R` programming, feel free to look over the chapters we skipped. In particular, the chapter on "Strings" if you want to work with text data, and "Dates & Times" if you want to work with time series.


## Overview

Up to now, we've been working with pretty tidy datasets. Every column is a variable, every row is an observation, and every value is where it should be. But things are not always this way. More often than you're going to like, data comes to you an unruly mess, and you'll need to tidy it up before you can even start to explore it.

This week, we'll learn some of the most important functions in the `tidyverse` for data importing, wrangling, and summarizing.

In your [last problem set](week-02.html#problem-set), you worked with a tidied up version of the Cooperative Election Study (CES) from 2020. Let's look at the steps I took to import and clean up that dataset.

### Importing The Data

The CES is a survey of a representative sample of 50,000+ American adults, conducted every election year by a large consortium of universities. The data going back to 2006 is available [here](https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/). Go to that site and download the 2020 dataset, a 180 megabyte monster called  `CES20_Common_OUTPUT_vv.csv`.

The `.csv` extension at the end of the file means that it is a "comma separated value" file. This is a file where all of the values are separated by commas. Looks something like this:

```
name, age, party
'Joe', 35, 'Bull Moose'
'Fiona', 6, 'Birthday'
'Avery', 3, 'Know Nothing'
```

It's a nice standardized way to represent datasets, and fortunately for us, the `read_csv()` function allows us to read such files into `R`. Let's create an object called `ces_raw` with the raw dataset.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

ces_raw <- read_csv('data/raw/CES20_Common_OUTPUT_vv.csv')

```

This dataset has a lot of information.

```{r}
dim(ces_raw)
```

61,000 rows and 717 columns, to be precise. The first few rows and columns look like this:

```{r}
head(ces_raw)
```

### Recoding Variables

Now that we have the dataset loaded into memory, let's find the variables we're interested in keeping and clean them up a bit. For example, gender is coded as a 1 or 2.

```{r}
ces_raw |> 
  count(gender)
```

Let's make this more readable. The codebook (available at the same site where you downloaded the data) says that 1 is male and 2 is female. We can create a new version of the gender column using the `mutate()` function.

```{r}
ces_clean <- ces_raw |> 
  mutate(gender = if_else(gender == 1, 'Male', 'Female'))

ces_clean |> 
  count(gender)
```

What about the education variable (`educ`)?

```{r}
ces_clean |> 
  count(educ)
```

That's a lot of categories to clean up. We can combine the `mutate()` function with `case_when()` to recode a bunch of different values at the same time.

```{r}
ces_clean <- ces_clean |> 
  mutate(educ = case_when(educ == 1 ~ 'No HS',
                          educ == 2 ~ 'High school graduate',
                          educ == 3 ~ 'Some college',
                          educ == 4 ~ '2-year',
                          educ == 5 ~ '4-year',
                          educ == 6 ~ 'Post-grad'))
ces_clean |> 
  count(educ)
```

Now the variable has the correct labels, but notice that the order in that table is kind of weird. We tend to think of education as an **ordinal** variable, because there's a natural order from least to most educated. But `R` doesn't know that yet. It just thinks of `educ` as a character variable, and lists them in alphabetical order. We can tell `R` about the variable order by recoding `educ` as a **factor**.

```{r}
ces_clean <- ces_clean |> 
  mutate(educ = factor(educ,
                       levels = c('No HS', 
                                  'High school graduate',
                                  'Some college',
                                  '2-year',
                                  '4-year',
                                  'Post-grad')))
ces_clean |> 
  count(educ)
```

Much better!

Now there's a variable in CES called `birthyr`. What if we wanted to know the respondents age in 2020 instead? The `mutate()` function can help us here too.

```{r}
ces_clean |> 
  count(birthyr)

ces_clean <- ces_clean |> 
  mutate(age = 2020 - birthyr)

ces_clean |> 
  count(birthyr, age)
```

### Joining Datasets

Here's another messy thing about this dataset. Every respondent has a variable called `inputstate`, representing the state where they live.

```{r}
ces_clean |> 
  count(inputstate)
```

But it's a number! A unique number representing each state called a FIPS code. Now I don't know all 51 state FIPS codes by heart, so these numbers aren't really helping me out. But I do have a dataset....


TO BE COMPLETED


### Selecting Variables

Finally, we can use the `select()` function to keep only the columns we want, and drop the columns we don't want.

```{r}
ces_clean <- ces_clean |> 
  select(caseid, gender, educ, age, state)
```
