\noindent So you want to be a political scientist? Cool! It's a fun and fulfilling profession. But before you can eat your cake, you need to eat your vegetables. In this analogy, cake is political science, and vegetables is math. Because modern political science is heavily quantitative, and in order to fruitfully engage with the ongoing scientific conversation, you will need to understand the language. 

I intend for this class to be a very practical introduction to the mathematical and computational skills you'll want to have as a professional political scientist. In Part 1 of the course (Discovery), you'll learn the programming skills you need to tidy, explore, and describe patterns in data. In Part 2 (Causality), you'll learn how to design research that convincingly distinguishes between correlation and causation. In Part 3 (Uncertainty), you'll learn the foundational statistical tools you need to communicate the uncertainty of your estimates and to generalize from samples to populations. And when we're done, you'll have the fundamentals you need to tackle the advanced material that makes up the rest of the methods sequence.

\section*{Course Objectives}
%\vskip.15in
%\noindent\textbf{Course Objectives:}  
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Confidently work with data using the \texttt{R} programming language
	\item Create beautiful and informative data visualizations
	\item Organize your work so that it is transparent and reproducible
	\item Build basic statistical models and estimate their parameters from data
	\item Communicate the uncertainty around your estimates
	\item Design research that can credibly identify causation (not just correlation)
%	\item Explain the fundamental mathematics behind the statistical methods we use in political science (probability and inference, matrix algebra, and optimization).
%	\item Manipulate, wrangle, and clean datasets using the \texttt{R} programming language
%	\item Create beautiful data visualizations
%	\item Organize your work so that it is transparent and reproducible
%	\item Compute derivatives and solve systems of linear equations
%	\item Explain the properties of probability distributions and expected values
%	\item Perform hypothesis tests and fit models to data
\end{itemize}

%\section*{Course Structure}
%
%This will be a weird semester, and I expect that there will be more than the usual share of setbacks and hardships. Please don't hesitate to ask questions or reach out to me with your concerns. 
%
%If you show any \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=covid-19+symptoms}{symptoms of COVID-19} or have been exposed to someone who tests positive for COVID-19, don't come to class. Obviously. I do not grade class attendance, and every piece of material that you need to succeed on assignments and tests will be made available online. I plan to simulcast our class sessions over Zoom and post recordings to the course website, and I will hold regular virtual office hours if you have questions that aren't covered in those places. 
%
%When you come to class, please wear a mask. The University System of Georgia (USG) requires all faculty, students, and staff to wear appropriate face coverings while inside campus buildings. Reasonable accommodations may be made for those who are unable to wear a face covering for documented health reasons. Students seeking an accommodation related to face coverings should contact Disability Services at \href{https://drc.uga.edu/}{https://drc.uga.edu/}. For more information on the University of Georgia's coronavirus response, visit \href{https://coronavirus.uga.edu/}{https://coronavirus.uga.edu/}. 
%
%Our classroom will have a limited capacity this semester (14 students), but that should be sufficient to have all enrolled students attend in person. Following the Thanksgiving break, all remaining class sessions will be held online. 

\section*{Assignments \& Grading}

Each week I will assign a problem set, due the Tuesday before class. Your responses will be graded for completion and reviewed in class. Feel free to work with your classmates, but please submit your answers individually. 70\% of your grade will come from these problem sets, and 15\% each from a midterm and final exam.

%\vskip.15in
%\noindent\textbf{Office Hours:} 
\section*{Office Hours and Email Policy}
I will be available for meetings every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon, and you can sign up for 20 minute appointments \href{https://calendly.com/joeornstein/20min}{here}. My office is Baldwin 304C, but if you prefer we can video chat over the class Discord server. (I will send invite links for the Discord in the first week of class). If you send me an email, please allow me 24 hours to respond. Like many professors, my inbox is pretty overloaded. Also, I have small children, so it's my policy to not check email after 5pm or on weekends. 

This semester, we have two senior graduate students staffing the SPIA Methods Helpdesk: Jason Lian and Austin Petrie. You can email them questions at \href{mailto:spia-methods-help@uga.edu}{spia-methods-help@uga.edu}.

\section*{Recommended Books}
I try to make my courses as cheap as possible, so all of the assigned readings for this class will be available free online (including a few of the textbooks listed below). However, if you're the sort of person that prefers reading hard copies, I recommend these books!

\section*{Tentative Course Outline}

Moltke the Elder writes that no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy. This is doubly true for syllabi. We may need to be flexible, and deviate from the plan if some topics require more or less attention, or we think of something completely unexpected that we want to do, and it takes up a few weeks. Caveats aside, here is what I have planned! %I've built in some Bonus Weeks towards the end of the semester that we can use for catch up. If everything goes according to plan, then we can cover extra topics during those weeks by popular demand.
