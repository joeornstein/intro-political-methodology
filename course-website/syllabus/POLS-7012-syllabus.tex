%\noindent So you want to be a political scientist? Cool! It's a fun and fulfilling profession. But before you can eat your cake, you need to eat your vegetables. In this analogy, cake is political science, and vegetables is math. Because modern political science is heavily quantitative, and in order to fruitfully engage with the ongoing scientific conversation, you will need to understand the language. 

\noindent This course will introduce the foundational mathematical and computational skills you will need to conduct and evaluate political science research. During the first half of the semester (Part 1: Fundamentals), we discuss the techniques that political scientists use to address three fundamental problems of scientific inquiry: measurement, causal inference, and sampling. In the second half of the semester (Part 2: Applications), we apply what we've learned to a series of miniature research projects, focusing on the practical computational skills you need to work with data. By the end of the semester, you will be armed with the necessary tools to tackle the more advanced material that makes up the rest of our graduate methods sequence. % In Part 1 of the course (Discovery), you'll learn the programming skills you need to tidy, explore, and describe patterns in data. In Part 2 (Causality), you'll learn how to design research that convincingly distinguishes between correlation and causation. In Part 3 (Uncertainty), you'll learn the foundational statistical tools you need to communicate the uncertainty of your estimates and to generalize from samples to populations.

%TODO Part 1 of the course is foundations, part 2 is getting our hands dirty

\section*{Course Objectives}
%\vskip.15in
%\noindent\textbf{Course Objectives:}
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Confidently work with data using the \texttt{R} programming language
	\item Create beautiful and informative data visualizations
	\item Organize your work so that it is transparent and reproducible
	\item Build basic statistical models and estimate their parameters from data
	\item Communicate the uncertainty around your estimates
	\item Identify research designs that credibly address three fundamental challenges of social science: measurement, causal inference, and sampling.
%	\item Explain the fundamental mathematics behind the statistical methods we use in political science (probability and inference, matrix algebra, and optimization).
%	\item Manipulate, wrangle, and clean datasets using the \texttt{R} programming language
%	\item Create beautiful data visualizations
%	\item Organize your work so that it is transparent and reproducible
%	\item Compute derivatives and solve systems of linear equations
%	\item Explain the properties of probability distributions and expected values
%	\item Perform hypothesis tests and fit models to data
\end{itemize}

%\section*{Course Structure}
%
%This will be a weird semester, and I expect that there will be more than the usual share of setbacks and hardships. Please don't hesitate to ask questions or reach out to me with your concerns.
%
%If you show any \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=covid-19+symptoms}{symptoms of COVID-19} or have been exposed to someone who tests positive for COVID-19, don't come to class. Obviously. I do not grade class attendance, and every piece of material that you need to succeed on assignments and tests will be made available online. I plan to simulcast our class sessions over Zoom and post recordings to the course website, and I will hold regular virtual office hours if you have questions that aren't covered in those places.
%
%When you come to class, please wear a mask. The University System of Georgia (USG) requires all faculty, students, and staff to wear appropriate face coverings while inside campus buildings. Reasonable accommodations may be made for those who are unable to wear a face covering for documented health reasons. Students seeking an accommodation related to face coverings should contact Disability Services at \href{https://drc.uga.edu/}{https://drc.uga.edu/}. For more information on the University of Georgia's coronavirus response, visit \href{https://coronavirus.uga.edu/}{https://coronavirus.uga.edu/}.
%
%Our classroom will have a limited capacity this semester (14 students), but that should be sufficient to have all enrolled students attend in person. Following the Thanksgiving break, all remaining class sessions will be held online.

\section*{Assignments \& Grading}

Each week I will assign 1-2 chapters of reading and a problem set, both due at noon the day of class. Feel free to consult your classmates with questions about the problem sets, but I expect you to submit your answers individually. \textbf{Resist the temptation to copy-paste your classmates' code.} You are much more likely to learn if you type your responses yourself. Each problem set will contain a \textbf{Bonus} problem that will require you to conduct some independent research beyond that week's reading. Problem sets will be graded pass/fail, where a passing grade indicates that you have correctly solved over 70\% of the problems. 

The semester will culminate with each student completing an independent research project. During the final two weeks, students will present an original analysis of a dataset of their choice. To meet expectations, the project should address in a satisfying way issues relating to measurement, causal inference, and sampling, and students should submit code and a codebook that allows others to replicate their analysis from the raw dataset. Within 48 hours of your presentation, I will provide you a list of revisions that I think would improve the research. Completing these revisions before the end of finals period is a requirement for earning an A- or A in the course. Students wishing to earn an A will---in addition to the presentation, code, and codebook---submit a final paper that includes an abstract, brief literature review, and discussion of their findings.

The final letter grade you earn for the semester will be determined based on the number of problem sets you complete that meet expectations, the number of bonus problems you successfully complete, and your performance on the final project. Consult the table below for the minimum requirements for each letter grade. To earn a given letter grade, you must complete the requirements for that grade and all the grades below it, and students must at least meet the requirements for a C to pass the course.\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	Letter Grade & Problem Sets & Bonus Problems & Final Project \\
	\hline
	A & 10 & 8 & Submit a final paper \\
	\hline
	A- & 9 & 5 & Complete requested revisions \\
	\hline
	B+ & 8 & 2 & Code successfully replicates \\
	\hline
	B & 7 & 0 & Provide code and codebook \\
	\hline
	C & 6 & 0 & Present final project \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

%\noindent\textbf{Office Hours:}
\section*{Office Hours and Email Policy}
I will be available for students to drop in and chat every Thursday afternoon from 2-4pm. My office is Baldwin 304C. If you send me an email, please allow me 24 hours to respond. Like many professors, my inbox is pretty overloaded. Also, I have small children, so it's my policy to not check email after 5pm or on weekends. You should feel free to seek assistance from the senior graduate students staffing the SPIA Methods Helpdesk. You can email them questions at \href{mailto:spia-methods-help@uga.edu}{spia-methods-help@uga.edu}.

Our readings will come from the two books listed below. The first book (DAFSS) must be purchased, but the second (R4DS) is freely available online.

%All of the assigned readings for this class will be available free online (including a few of the textbooks listed below). However, if you're the sort of person that prefers reading hard copies, I recommend these books!

\section*{Course Outline}

%Moltke the Elder writes that no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy. This is doubly true for syllabi. We may need to be flexible, and deviate from the plan if some topics require more or less attention, or we think of something completely unexpected that we want to do, and it takes up a few weeks. Caveats aside, here is what I have planned! %I've built in some Bonus Weeks towards the end of the semester that we can use for catch up. If everything goes according to plan, then we can cover extra topics during those weeks by popular demand.
