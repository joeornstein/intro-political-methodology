## Reading

Our guide to causal inference is *The Effect*, by Nick Huntington-Klein. The whole book is great, but start with:

- [Chapter 6: Causal Diagrams](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-CausalDiagrams.html)
- [Chapter 7: Drawing Causal Diagrams](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-DrawingCausalDiagrams.html)

## Problem Set

Consider a research question you're interested in and draw a DAG to represent the web of relevant causal relationships - `R` or by hand are both acceptable. What are the backdoor paths between your treatment and outcome (i.e. alternative explanations)? What variables must you condition on to close them?
