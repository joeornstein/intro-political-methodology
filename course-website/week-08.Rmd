## Reading Assignments

Next week we explore the world of matrix algebra. Moore & Siegel are our guides:

-   [Moore & Siegel](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ugalib/reader.action?docID=1205618), Chapter 12. Ignore sections 12.3.6 and 12.3.7 on computing determinants and inverses by hand. We have computers that do that for us now.

## Problem Set

Consider a research question you're interested in and draw a DAG to represent the web of relevant causal relationships - `R` or by hand are both acceptable. What are the backdoor paths between your treatment and outcome (i.e. alternative explanations)? What variables must you condition on to close them?
