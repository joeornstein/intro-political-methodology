This week we introduce the **linear model**, the workhorse of empirical social science. By the end of this week, you will be able to:

-   Fit a linear model in `R`, interpret the results, and use the fitted model to make predictions about unobserved data points.

-   Determine when and how to compute logarithmic transformations of continuous variables.

-   Use differential calculus to optimize functions, and explain the link between optimization and the least-squares estimator for the linear model.
