# Syllabus

This course will introduce the foundational mathematical and computational skills you will need to conduct and evaluate political science research. During the first half of the semester (Part 1: Fundamentals), we discuss the techniques that political scientists use to address three fundamental problems of scientific inquiry: measurement, causal inference, and sampling. In the second half of the semester (Part 2: Applications), we apply what we've learned to a series of miniature research projects, focusing on the practical computational skills you need to work with data. By the end of the semester, you will be armed with the necessary tools to tackle the more advanced material that makes up the rest of our graduate methods sequence.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

-   Confidently work with data using the `R` programming language

-   Create beautiful and informative data visualizations

-   Organize your work so that it is transparent and reproducible

-   Build basic statistical models and estimate their parameters from data

-   Communicate uncertainty around your estimates

-   Identify research designs that credibly address three fundamental challenges of social science: measurement, causal inference, and sampling.

## Assignments & Grading

Each week I will assign 1-2 chapters of reading and a problem set, both due at noon the day of class. Feel free to work collaboratively with your classmates on the problem sets, but please submit your answers individually. **Resist the temptation to copy-paste your classmates' code.** You are much more likely to learn if you type your responses yourself. 70% of your grade will come from these problem sets, and 15% each from a take-home midterm and final exam.

## Office Hours and Email Policy

I will be available for students to drop in and chat every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon from 1:30-3pm. My office is Baldwin 304C. If you send me an email, please allow me 24 hours to respond. Like many professors, my inbox is pretty overloaded. Also, I have small children, so it's my policy to not check email after 5pm or on weekends. You should feel free to seek assistance from the senior graduate students staffing the SPIA Methods Helpdesk. You can email them questions at **spia-methods-help\@uga.edu**.

## Books

Our readings will come from the two books listed below. The first book (DAFSS) must be purchased---either in hard-copy or through the course [Perusall](https://app.perusall.com/courses/introduction-to-political-methodology/) site---but the second (R4DS) is freely available online.

-   **DAFSS**: Llaudet, Elena & Imai, Kosuke (2022). [Data Analysis for Social Science: A Friendly and Practical Introduction](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691199436/data-analysis-for-social-science). Princeton University Press.

-   **R4DS**: Wickham, H., Cetinkaya-Rundel, M., & Grolemund, G., (2023). [R For Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), 2nd Edition. O'Reilly Media, Inc.
