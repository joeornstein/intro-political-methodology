Welcome to our course website! You can find links to the course syllabus in the upper right, and schedule in the drop-down menu on the upper right, which includes each week's class notes and assignments. Please complete the assigned reading and problems set by noon before the class meets that week.

There are a few other useful links in the The book icon in the upper right is a link to our class [Perusall](https://app.perusall.com/courses/introduction-to-political-methodology/) page.

# Syllabus

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

-   Confidently work with data using the `R` programming language

-   Create beautiful and informative data visualizations

-   Organize your work so that it is transparent and reproducible

-   Build basic statistical models and estimate their parameters from data

-   Communicate the uncertainty around your estimates

-   Describe research designs that can credibly identify causation (not just correlation)

## Assignments & Grading

Each week I will assign a problem set, due at noon the day of class. Your responses will be graded pass-fail (a passing problem set demonstrates a solid grasp of the concepts from that week\'s reading, even if there are some mistakes in implementation). Feel free to work with your classmates, but please submit your answers individually. 70% of your grade will come from these problem sets, and 15% each from a midterm and final exam.

## Office Hours and Email Policy

I will be available for students to drop in and chat every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon from 1:30-3pm. My office is Baldwin 304C. If you send me an email, please allow me 24 hours to respond. Like many professors, my inbox is pretty overloaded. Also, I have small children, so it\'s my policy to not check email after 5pm or on weekends. You should feel free to seek assistance from the senior graduate students staffing the SPIA Methods Helpdesk. You can email them questions at **spia-methods-help\@uga.edu**.
