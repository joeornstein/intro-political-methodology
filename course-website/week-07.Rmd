Next week we discuss the art of causal inference. Our guide is *The Effect*, by Nick Huntington-Klein. The whole book is great, but start with:

- [Chapter 6: Causal Diagrams](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-CausalDiagrams.html)
- [Chapter 7: Drawing Causal Diagrams](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-DrawingCausalDiagrams.html)
- [Chapter 8: Closing Back Doors](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-CausalPaths.html)


## Problem Set

Practice a bit with calculus [here](problem-sets/problem-set-06.pdf). Complete and submit to eLC in any format you like.
