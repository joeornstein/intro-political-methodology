This week you'll present a project that follows the entire data analysis pipeline from start to finish: finding the dataset, importing it, cleaning it up, summarizing it, and building visualizations.

If you're looking for additional practice with the skills we've learned over the past six weeks, I highly recommend the [RStudio primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), a set of interactive online tutorials. To review the functions we've covered so far, check out "The Basics", "Work With Data", "Visualize Data", and "Tidy Your Data". The other primers are more advanced `R` functions -- you may try them if you're looking for an extra challenge. 

## Problem Set

Practice a bit with calculus [here](problem-sets/problem-set-06.pdf). Complete and submit to eLC in any format you like.
