In the final two weeks of the semester we will present our final projects to the class. There will be no reading assignments or problem sets due.

Thank you for sharing your valuable time with me this semester. We've covered a lot, but I hope that you will come away from the class feeling more confident in your ability to conduct research and contribute to the conversation in political science. I look forward to seeing what you will do!
