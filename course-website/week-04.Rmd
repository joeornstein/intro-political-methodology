  Wrangle that data into shape

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Up to now, we've been working with pretty tidy datasets. Every column is a variable, every row is an observation, and every value is where it should be. But things are not always this way. More often than you're going to like, data comes to you an unruly mess, and you'll need to tidy it up before you can even start to explore it.

Over the next few weeks, we'll learn some of the most important functions in the `tidyverse` for data importing, wrangling, and summarizing. We'll introduce the essential **summary statistics** that we use to describe central tendency, variation, and correlation.

## Reading Assignments

Before next week, read up on:

1. How to  **join** information from two dataframes together. `left_join()` is the most useful. Here's a [good explanation](https://stat545.com/join-cheatsheet.html#left_joinsuperheroes-publishers), and here's an [interactive primer](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/4.3).[^hyp]
2. [Teacups, Giraffes, and Statistics](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html) (Modules 1-5)

[^hyp]: Warning: doesn't play nice with Hypothesis highlights, but you can still leave page notes. 

## Problem Set

No problem set due this week.
