  abstract = {Surveys are a crucial tool for understanding public opinion and behaviour, and their accuracy depends on maintaining statistical representativeness of their target populations by minimizing biases from all sources. Increasing data size shrinks confidence intervals but magnifies the effect of survey bias:~an instance of the Big Data Paradox1. Here we demonstrate this paradox in estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccine uptake in US adults from 9 January to 19 May 2021 from two large surveys: Delphi\textendash Facebook2,3 (about 250,000 responses per week) and Census Household Pulse4 (about 75,000 every two weeks). In May 2021, Delphi\textendash Facebook overestimated uptake by 17 percentage points (14\textendash 20 percentage points with 5\% benchmark imprecision) and Census Household Pulse by 14 (11\textendash 17 percentage points with 5\% benchmark imprecision), compared to a retroactively updated benchmark the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on 26 May 2021. Moreover, their large sample sizes led to miniscule margins of error on the incorrect estimates. By contrast, an Axios\textendash Ipsos~online panel5 with about 1,000 responses per week following survey research best practices6 provided reliable estimates and uncertainty quantification. We decompose observed error using a recent analytic framework1 to explain the inaccuracy in the three surveys. We~then analyse the implications for vaccine hesitancy and willingness. We show how a survey of 250,000 respondents can produce an estimate of the~population mean that is no more accurate than an estimate from a simple random sample of size 10. Our central message is that data quality matters more than data quantity, and that compensating the former with the latter is a mathematically provable losing proposition.},

  abstract = {Statisticians are increasingly posed with thought-provoking and even paradoxical questions, challenging our qualifications for entering the statistical paradises created by Big Data. By developing measures for data quality, this article suggests a framework to address such a question: "Which one should I trust more: a 1\% survey with 60\% response rate or a self-reported administrative dataset covering 80\% of the population?" A 5-element Euler-formula-like identity shows that for any dataset of size n, probabilistic or not, the difference between the sample average X n and the population average X N is the product of three terms: (1) a data quality measure, {$\rho$} R,X , the correlation between X j and the response/recording indicator R j ; (2) a data quantity measure, {$\surd$} (N - n)/n, where N is the population size; and (3) a problem difficulty measure, {$\sigma$} X , the standard deviation of X. This decomposition provides multiple insights: (I) Probabilistic sampling ensures high data quality by controlling {$\rho$} R,X at the level of N -1/2 ; (II) When we lose this control , the impact of N is no longer canceled by {$\rho$} R,X , leading to a Law of Large Populations (LLP), that is, our estimation error, relative to the benchmarking rate 1/ {$\surd$} n, increases with {$\surd$} N; and (III) the "bigness" of such Big Data (for population inferences) should be measured by the relative size f = n/N , not the absolute size n; (IV) When combining data sources for population inferences , those relatively tiny but higher quality ones should be given far more weights than suggested by their sizes. Estimates obtained from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) of the 2016 US presidential election suggest a {$\rho$} R,X {$\approx$} -0.005 for self-reporting to vote for Donald Trump. Because of LLP, this seemingly minuscule data defect correlation implies that the simple sample proportion of the self-reported voting preference for Trump from 1\% of the US eligible voters, that is, n {$\approx$} 2,300,000, has the same mean squared error as the corresponding sample proportion from a genuine simple random sample of size n {$\approx$} 400, a 99.98\% reduction of sample size (and hence our confidence).
