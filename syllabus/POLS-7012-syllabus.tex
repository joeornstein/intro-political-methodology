\noindent So you want to be a political scientist? Cool! It's a fun and fulfilling profession. But before you can eat your cake, you need to eat your vegetables. In this analogy, cake is political science, and vegetables is math. Because a lot of modern political science is heavily quantitative, and in order to fruitfully engage with the ongoing scientific conversation, you will need to understand the language. 

This course will be a practical introduction to the mathematical and computational skills you'll want to have as a professional political scientist. You'll learn how to manipulate, describe, and visualize data. You'll learn calculus, the branch of mathematics we use to find \textit{optima}. You'll learn probability, which we use to tell the difference between patterns in data and random noise. And when we're done, you'll be ready to start estimating models in the next two semesters of the methods sequence. 

\section*{Course Objectives}
%\vskip.15in
%\noindent\textbf{Course Objectives:}  
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Confidently work with data and create beautiful visualizations using the \texttt{R} programming language
	\item Organize your work so that it is transparent and reproducible
	\item Explain the fundamental mathematics behind the statistical methods we use in political science (probability and inference, matrix algebra, and optimization).
%	\item Manipulate, wrangle, and clean datasets using the \texttt{R} programming language
%	\item Create beautiful data visualizations
%	\item Organize your work so that it is transparent and reproducible
%	\item Compute derivatives and solve systems of linear equations
%	\item Explain the properties of probability distributions and expected values
%	\item Perform hypothesis tests and fit models to data
\end{itemize}


\section*{Assignments \& Grading}

Each week, I will assign a problem set. Feel free to work with your classmates, but please submit your answers individually. 70\% of your grade will come from these problem sets, and 15\% each from a midterm and final exam.

%\vskip.15in
%\noindent\textbf{Office Hours:} 
\section*{Office Hours}
Every Wednesday from noon to 1pm I will hold Virtual Office Hours over Zoom. I will put a sign-up spreadsheet on the course website. I'm also available before and after class to chat.

\section*{Tentative Course Outline}

Von Moltke writes that no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy. The same is true for syllabi. The following schedule is a rough outline that I may need to adjust on the fly. For instance, can I teach you everything you need to know about calculus in one week? Maybe! But if not, I've built in some Bonus Weeks towards the end of the semester that we can use for catch up. If everything goes according to plan, then we can cover extra topics during those weeks by populat demand.

\subsection*{Academic Honesty}
Remember that when you joined the University of Georgia community, you agreed to abide by a code of conduct outlined in the academic honesty policy called \href{https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/Introduction/}{\textit{A Culture of Honesty}}. COVID-19 hasn't changed any of that. Problem sets may be completed in groups, but I expect your responses to be individual, and the midterm and final must be completed individually.
