Motivate with sampling beans from a jar (voters from the population) instead of coin flipping.
That way segueing to the *sampling distribution* becomes quite natural.

Start with probability, then do inference?

"You've got a jar with 10,000 beans: 55% red balls and 45% red balls."

Let's sample from the jar. my_sample <- jar %>% sample_n(100).

Create code to find the pct_blue from your sample. ()

Give students a dataset to import, then have them each do sample. See what the variation looks like.

If we conducted a bunch of polls, drawing random samples of 100 balls from the jar, what would the *sampling distribution* look like?

Collect data, compute a statistic. How *unusual* would that statistic be if...?
