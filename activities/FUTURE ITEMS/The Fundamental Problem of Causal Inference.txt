No amount of fancy statistical footwork gets you around the FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OF CAUSAL INFERENCE

We believe that Y_i = f(X_i). Each observation not only has the *observed* outcomes, but also a bunch of *potential* outcomes depending on the value of X_i. We say that X causes Y if assigning i a different X would yield a different Y, on average. The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is that we can never observe all of an individual's potential outcomes. We only see one!

So that's why we like datasets with more than one observation. We get to observe outcomes for units with different values of X and see if there's a relationship.

But once we start comparing outcomes across observations, we confront a new problem: CONFOUNDING. To understand confounding, lets first learn about DAGs.
